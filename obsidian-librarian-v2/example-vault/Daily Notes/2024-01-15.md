Discussed the need for better knowledge management. Team is excited about automating our documentation workflow.

Key points:
- Need to reduce duplicate documentation

- Templates should be applied consistently

## Ideas

- Create a plugin that integrates with our CI/CD pipeline
- Automate weekly research digests
- Build a dashboard for vault statistics
