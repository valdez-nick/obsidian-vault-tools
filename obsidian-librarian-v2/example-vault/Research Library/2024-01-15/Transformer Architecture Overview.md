# Transformer Architecture Overview

## Summary

The Transformer architecture has revolutionized natural language processing and beyond. This research compilation provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, its components, and recent developments.

## Key Points

- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows models to process entire sequences simultaneously
- **Positional Encoding**: Injects sequence order information into the model
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Enables the model to attend to different representation subspaces
- **Scalability**: Parallelizable architecture enables training on massive datasets
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks

## Architecture Components

### 1. Input Embedding Layer
Converts tokens into dense vector representations. Modern transformers use learned embeddings with dimensions typically ranging from 512 to 4096.

### 2. Positional Encoding
Since transformers lack inherent sequence order understanding, positional encodings are added:
```
PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
```

### 3. Multi-Head Attention
The core innovation that allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces:
- Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices
- Attention scores: `Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V`
- Multiple attention heads learn different relationships

### 4. Feed-Forward Network
Each transformer block contains a position-wise feed-forward network:
- Two linear transformations with ReLU activation
- Typically expands dimension by 4x internally

### 5. Layer Normalization
Applied before each sub-layer to stabilize training:
- Normalizes across features rather than batch
- Includes learnable scale and shift parameters

## Recent Developments

### Efficient Transformers
- **Linformer**: Linear complexity through low-rank approximation
- **Performer**: Uses random features for attention approximation
- **Flash Attention**: Optimized GPU kernels for faster training

### Architectural Variants
- **GPT Series**: Decoder-only architecture for generation
- **BERT**: Bidirectional encoder for understanding
- **T5**: Encoder-decoder with unified text-to-text framework
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Adaptation for computer vision

## Implementation Considerations

### Memory Requirements
- Attention mechanism has O(n²) memory complexity
- For sequence length n=2048, requires ~16GB for attention alone
- Gradient checkpointing can reduce memory at computation cost

### Training Strategies
1. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Warmup followed by decay
2. **Gradient Clipping**: Prevent exploding gradients
3. **Mixed Precision**: FP16 training for efficiency
4. **Distributed Training**: Model and data parallelism

## Applications

### Natural Language Processing
- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Question answering
- Code generation

### Computer Vision
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Video understanding

### Multimodal
- CLIP: Vision-language understanding
- DALL-E: Text-to-image generation
- Flamingo: Vision-language tasks

## Code Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, n_heads, d_ff, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(d_model, n_heads)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        
        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(d_model, d_ff),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(d_ff, d_model)
        )
        
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Self-attention with residual connection
        attn_output, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)
        x = self.norm1(x + self.dropout(attn_output))
        
        # Feed-forward with residual connection
        ff_output = self.feed_forward(x)
        x = self.norm2(x + self.dropout(ff_output))
        
        return x
