# Project Alpha - ML Pipeline Optimization

## Overview

Optimizing our machine learning pipeline for better performance and scalability.

## Goals

1. Reduce training time by 50%
2. Implement distributed training
3. Automate hyperparameter tuning
4. Create monitoring dashboard

## Current Status

- [x] Initial performance profiling
- [x] Identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement data pipeline optimization
- [ ] Add distributed training support
- [ ] Create monitoring system

## Technical Details

### Architecture

Using a combination of:
- PyTorch for model training
- Ray for distributed computing
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- DVC for data versioning

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Training Time | 4 hours | 2 hours |
| GPU Utilization | 65% | 90% |
| Data Loading | 30 min | 10 min |
