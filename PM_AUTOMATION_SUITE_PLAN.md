4. **Template Engine**: Create PM-specific template library
5. **Orchestration Layer**: Use Intelligence Orchestrator for workflow coordination

### Data Flow Pattern (Reusable for all workflows)
```
Data Sources â†’ MCP Extraction â†’ AI Processing â†’ Template Generation â†’ 
Backup Creation â†’ Content Application â†’ Verification â†’ Stakeholder Distribution
```

### User Experience Pattern
1. **Auto-Detection**: System identifies data updates needing processing
2. **Smart Processing**: AI analyzes and structures content  
3. **Preview & Approve**: User reviews generated content
4. **Safe Application**: Hybrid backup enables instant undo
5. **Distribution**: Automated stakeholder notifications

## Key Benefits
- **Time Savings**: 70-80% reduction in manual data aggregation time
