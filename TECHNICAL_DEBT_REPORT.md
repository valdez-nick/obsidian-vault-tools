# Technical Debt and Incomplete Features Report

**Generated**: 2025-06-19  
**Status**: Active Technical Debt Tracking

## Executive Summary

This report documents technical debt, incomplete features, and areas needing improvement in the Obsidian Vault Tools codebase. Items are prioritized by security impact, user impact, and technical risk.

## 1. üî¥ Critical Security Issues

### 1.1 ML Model Serialization (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Location**: `/ai/adapters/models/classifier_adapter.py` (lines 289, 320)
- **Issue**: Uses `pickle.dump()` and `pickle.load()` for model persistence
- **Risk**: Arbitrary code execution vulnerability
- **Solution**: Implement safe serialization using joblib with hash verification or ONNX format
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed (2025-06-19)
  - Replaced pickle with joblib for model serialization
  - Added SHA256 hash verification for model integrity
  - Separated metadata into JSON files
  - Updated both `/ai/` and `/models/` versions

### 1.2 Shell Command Injection Risk
- **Locations**: 
  - `vault_manager_enhanced.py`
  - `manager/vault_manager.py`
  - `creative/ascii_art_converter.py`
- **Issue**: `subprocess` calls with `shell=True`
- **Risk**: Command injection if user input reaches these calls
- **Solution**: Use subprocess with list arguments, no shell
- **Status**: üü° Partially Fixed (2025-06-19)
  - ‚úÖ Fixed in `creative/ascii_art_converter.py` - replaced os.system with subprocess.run
  - ‚úÖ Fixed in `creative/ascii_magic_converter.py` - replaced os.system with subprocess.run
  - ‚úÖ Fixed in `manager/vault_manager.py` - replaced shell=True with shlex.split
  - ‚ùå Still needs fixing in `vault_manager_enhanced.py` and duplicates

## 2. üü° Incomplete Features

### 2.1 Stubbed Implementations
- **scikit-learn fallback**: Dummy classes when sklearn not available
- **Impact**: Features silently fail without proper user notification
- **Files**: `classifier_adapter.py`, `embedding_adapter.py`

### 2.2 Missing Integrations
- **Homebrew tap**: Referenced in README but not configured
- **MCP servers**: Some servers mentioned but not fully integrated
- **Git sync**: Mentioned but implementation incomplete

### 2.3 Placeholder Features
- Multiple "coming soon" and "not implemented" markers found
- Test files with extensive mocking instead of real implementations

## 3. üü† Performance Issues

### 3.1 Database Performance
- **Issue**: No connection pooling for database operations
- **Impact**: Poor performance under load
- **Location**: `obsidian-librarian-v2/python/obsidian_librarian/database/`

### 3.2 Async/Sync Mixing
- **Issue**: Synchronous SQLite operations in async contexts
- **Impact**: Thread blocking, poor concurrency
- **Example**: `cache.py` uses `run_in_executor` extensively

### 3.3 Large Operation Handling
- **Issue**: Some batch operations process entire datasets at once
- **Impact**: Memory issues with large vaults
- **Solution**: Implement proper chunking and streaming

## 4. üü¢ Code Quality Issues

### 4.1 Code Duplication
- **Duplicate directories**: `/ai/` and `/models/` contain similar code
- **Impact**: Maintenance burden, inconsistency risk
- **Solution**: Consolidate into single location

### 4.2 Error Handling
```python
# Found patterns:
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Generic error: {e}")
    # No recovery, no specific handling
```
- **Issue**: Generic exception catching without proper handling
- **Impact**: Difficult debugging, poor error recovery

### 4.3 Configuration Management
- Hardcoded values scattered throughout codebase
- Configuration validation is minimal
- API keys stored insecurely in some places

## 5. üìö Documentation Gaps

### 5.1 Missing Files
- **CLAUDE.md**: Referenced but doesn't exist
- **Architecture docs**: No high-level architecture documentation
- **API documentation**: Limited docstrings in some modules

### 5.2 Outdated Documentation
- README features that aren't fully implemented
- Installation instructions for non-existent packages
- No changelog or version history

## 6. üß™ Testing Gaps

### 6.1 Integration Tests
- Heavy reliance on mocks instead of real service tests
- No end-to-end tests with actual external services
- Missing performance benchmarks

### 6.2 Test Coverage
- No coverage reports generated
- Some modules have no tests at all
- Edge cases not well tested

## 7. üìä Technical Debt Metrics

### File Counts
- Files with TODO/FIXME: 54
- Files with security issues: 11
- Files > 500 lines: 8
- Duplicate implementations: 6

### Code Patterns
- `try/except` blocks: 200+
- Generic exceptions: 150+
- Hardcoded values: 50+
- Shell subprocess calls: 11

## 8. üéØ Prioritized Action Plan

### Immediate (Security Critical)
1. **Fix pickle usage** in classifier_adapter.py
2. **Remove shell=True** from all subprocess calls
3. **Implement input validation** for user-provided data

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Add connection pooling** for databases
2. **Fix async/sync mixing** issues
3. **Consolidate duplicate code**
4. **Add proper error handling**

### Medium Term (1 month)
1. **Complete stub implementations**
2. **Add missing documentation**
3. **Implement proper configuration management**
4. **Add integration tests**

### Long Term (3 months)
1. **Refactor large modules** into smaller components
2. **Implement proper logging and monitoring**
3. **Add performance optimizations**
4. **Complete all "coming soon" features**

## 9. üîç Monitoring and Tracking

### Metrics to Track
- Security vulnerabilities fixed: 0/2
- Stub implementations replaced: 0/10
- Test coverage: Currently unmeasured
- Performance benchmarks: Not established

### Success Criteria
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- All features fully implemented or removed
- 80%+ test coverage
- All TODO/FIXME comments addressed

## 10. üìù Notes and Recommendations

1. **Consider adopting a linter** like ruff or pylint with strict settings
2. **Implement pre-commit hooks** to catch issues early
3. **Set up CI/CD** with security scanning
4. **Create a deprecation policy** for old code
5. **Establish code review requirements** for security-sensitive changes
