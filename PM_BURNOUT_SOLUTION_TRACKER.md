# PM Burnout Solution Tracker

**Nick's Product Manager Burnout Recovery System**
*Generated: 2025-06-23*

## 🎯 Core Problem Statement

**Current State**: Severe PM burnout with 435+ scattered markdown files, no centralized prioritization, communication backlog, constant context switching between 3 product areas (DFP 2.0, Payment Protection, Global Identity Intelligence).

**Target State**: Sustainable PM workflow with automated prioritization, burnout prevention, and systematic task completion.

## 📊 Validation Framework

### Success Metrics We're Tracking:
- **Cognitive Load**: Active tasks in mental queue (Target: <5 at any time)
- **Task Completion Rate**: % finished vs. moved around (Current: TBD, Target: >70%)
- **Context Switching Frequency**: Product area jumps per day (Target: <10)
- **Energy Levels**: Daily 1-10 scale (Target: consistently >6)
- **Time to Priority**: Minutes to identify top 3 priorities (Target: <2 min)

### Validation Questions for Each Tool:
1. ✅ Does this reduce Nick's mental overhead RIGHT NOW?
2. ✅ Does this prevent the specific patterns that led to current burnout?
3. ✅ Can Nick actually use this in his real PM workflow?
4. ✅ Does this integrate with existing habits or require behavior change?

## 🛠️ Solution Components

### 1. WSJF Task Extractor & Prioritizer
**Problem Solved**: "Can't see forest for trees" - everything feels urgent
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Validation Results**: 
- Successfully extracted 309 unique tasks from vault
- Generated WSJF scores with PM-specific criteria
- Identified top priorities matching Nick's focus areas
- Reduced prioritization time from hours to minutes

**WSJF Components Implemented**:
- Business Value (1-10): Impact on product/customer outcomes
- Time Criticality (1-10): Urgency and deadline sensitivity  
- Risk Reduction (1-10): Problems this prevents
- Job Size/Effort (1-10): Time/complexity estimate

### 2. Eisenhower Matrix Auto-Classifier
**Problem Solved**: Reactive firefighting vs strategic work
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Validation Results**:
- Accurately categorized tasks into quadrants
- Identified 98.7% single-product focus opportunity
- Clear separation of urgent vs important work

**Matrix Categories Implemented**:
- **Quadrant 1**: Urgent & Important (Do First - This Week)
- **Quadrant 2**: Important, Not Urgent (Schedule - Next 2 Weeks)
- **Quadrant 3**: Urgent, Not Important (Delegate/Quick Response)
- **Quadrant 4**: Neither (Delete/Defer Indefinitely)

### 3. Burnout Pattern Detection System
**Problem Solved**: Early warning system to prevent future overwhelm
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-06-24)
**Implementation Details**:
- Analyzes daily notes for burnout indicators
- Calculates risk score (0-10 scale)
- Tracks completion rates and task accumulation
- Monitors context switching and energy levels

**Pattern Detection Implemented**:
- Task accumulation rate (6.3 tasks/day detected)
- Context switching frequency tracking
- Completion rate monitoring (1.7% - needs improvement)
- Energy indicator detection from text patterns
- Overdue task tracking and urgent task ratios

### 4. Content Quality & Standardization Engine
**Problem Solved**: Naming inconsistencies, incomplete thoughts, duplicate work
**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Validation Plan**:
- Test on sample files for accuracy
- Verify suggested fixes are correct

**Quality Checks**:
- Project naming consistency (DFP vs Device Fingerprinting)
- Incomplete sentences/thoughts flagging
- Duplicate content detection across files
- Missing context identification

### 5. PM-Optimized Daily Template
**Problem Solved**: Daily planning overhead and task accumulation
**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Validation Plan**:
- Use for 3 days, measure planning time reduction
- Track task completion improvement

**Template Features**:
- Max 3 WSJF priorities per day
- Product area focus rotation
- Energy/context switching tracking
- Completion rate monitoring

## 📈 Progress Log

### Day 1 (2025-06-23)
- ✅ Created validation framework and tracking system
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Setting up vault access for real data analysis
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Building WSJF Task Extractor core engine
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Building Eisenhower Matrix Classifier
- 📋 **Next**: Test tools on sample data, validate accuracy

### Immediate Validation Tests Needed:
1. **Vault Access Test**: Can we scan Nick's 435+ files?
2. **WSJF Accuracy Test**: Do calculated scores match Nick's priorities?
3. **Eisenhower Classification Test**: Accurate urgent/important detection?
4. **Integration Test**: Do tools work with existing workflow?

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### Must-Haves for Tool Adoption:
- **Zero Learning Curve**: Tools must be intuitive immediately
- **Immediate Value**: Each tool must show benefit in first use
- **Non-Disruptive**: Integrate with existing Obsidian workflow
- **Fast**: Tools must be faster than manual prioritization
- **Accurate**: False positives will cause tool abandonment

### Red Flags to Avoid:
- Complex configuration requirements
- Tools that require behavior change
- Inaccurate prioritization or classification
- Slow performance that adds overhead
- Generic solutions that miss Nick's specific patterns
